  <div class="grid">
    <img src="images/art7.jpeg" data-title="Serpent Gaze"
      data-size='24" × 24"' data-desc="A powerful portrait inspired by indigenous strength and primal emotion. Purple dominates the canvas, where piercing eyes echo both vigilance and resilience. The layered textures evoke transformation, echoing the quiet tension between instinct and awareness.">

    <img src="images/art4.jpeg" data-title="Bound Silence"
      data-size='36" × 24"' data-desc="A contemplative figure defined only by outline, seated within a historical red and yellow landscape. The absence of facial identity becomes a statement — reflecting eras where women existed within boundaries, thinking deeply yet unheard.">

    <img src="images/art2.jpeg" data-title="Emerging Light"
      data-size='12" × 12"' data-desc="A modern female portrait marked by confidence and clarity. One half blooms with vibrant color, while the other remains untouched — symbolizing evolution, balance, and the moment between becoming and being.">

    <img src="images/art5.jpeg" data-title="Traditional Reimagined"
      data-size='24" × 36"' data-desc="Eyes closed in introspection, this work merges contemporary femininity with traditional elegance. Rich colors and expressive makeup celebrate inner calm, cultural memory, and emotional self-awareness.">
